figure out where onSaveContact method shold be there

first make apis for all these post and put request made by the subsections

okay nvm , what if I want all subsections to call to all different api but access the same university id which is generated when a person makes the post requests in any of
 the sections,so that all subsequent requests are directed to put request rather that post request for that 

subscribe to formapi service in all subsections to update the data.(do it differently for contact details component)
or do it differently for all subsections

make sure if all the controllers do the work , you want them to , like university resource must not include anything about contact or campus

create second page in pdf using itext

create cover page and dashboard page

think about how to exit the form menu

work out how will you save the information written, also think about an alert when a user is trying to change the section or subsection
without saving changes

also think the logic to enable and disable the submit button

generate pdf using dynamic data for just one university

add spring security

add cookies to determine which university is logged in and thus save the interim data accordingly for a given university    


See why is it showing that .subscribe is deprecated
watch angular course content from angular dynamic components

see how environment variables are added to angular and springboot
