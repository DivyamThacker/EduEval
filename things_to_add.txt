start with backend resource of each subsection and then connect backend with frontend

see where the areUnsavedChanges variable should be handled (look in services and in formActionsComponent)


Think if you want to manage seperate areUnsavedChanges varialbe in each subsection and also universityId

think if you want to sepreate basic form data service to each subsection in frontend

remember to send the section name/ string in the NEP detials page
 
map and add the integrated programmes into the normal enrollment

add aws database rather that h2 and configure it

complete the DataFormaterService in backend

get the data that and fill the interim forms using it so that one can edit or add the new data and 
also see what already data exists on backend

also figure out how to structurize the storage of the files in S3 storage (that is .. send prefixes)

start with collegeStats model and SraProgramme model , handle both seperately, add their attribute in University.java

think if repo is needed for SraProgramme or not

think if all sections need to be managed to be in common form-data-service because UniversityId is needed everywhere, or find
another way to get university Id whenever you need (maybe take the universityId as one by default in all the feilds , when someone logs
in we would be able to access the university Id)

Start with academic subsections

first make apis for all these post and put request made by the subsections

check for validation that if recognition date is there then document should also be tehre and vice versa

Ignore staff and staffresource for now , as they are shaped according to the api given by the company and differnt from us

think about can we fix the error where we try to fill contactDetails or any other component before basic-info component

unset areUnsavedChanges in onSaveChanges method only if the response is received , do not unset while there is error

add guard to every form tab in the app.routes


write effecient code in extended profile form frontend

subscribe to formapi service in all subsections to update the data.(do it differently for contact details component)
or do it differently for all subsections

make sure if all the controllers do the work , you want them to 

create all pages of profile section in the pdf

think about how will you get and upload the text data to azure storage and show it in the generated ssr

add validators to all form in frontend

work out how will you save the information written, also think about an alert when a user is trying to change the section or subsection
without saving changes

give correct label names and ids in the html code of all components in extended-profile 

generate pdf using dynamic data for just one university

add spring security

add cookies to determine which university is logged in and thus save the interim data accordingly for a given university    

watch angular course content from angular dynamic components
